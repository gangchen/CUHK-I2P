## Overview
.cite[
The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.]

.cite[
The Biopython web site (http://www.biopython.org) provides an online resource for modules, scripts, and web links for developers of Python-based software for bioinformatics use and research.

## Features

* The ability to parse bioinformatics files into Python utilizable data structures. Files in the supported formats can be iterated over record by record or indexed and accessed via a Dictionary interface.
* Code to deal with popular on-line bioinformatics destinations.
* Interfaces to common bioinformatics programs.
* A standard sequence class that deals with sequences, ids on sequences, and sequence features.
* Tools for performing common operations on sequences, such as translation, transcription and weight calculations.
* Code to perform classification of data using k Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines.

## Features cont.
* Code for dealing with alignments, including a standard way to create and deal with substitution matrices.
* Code making it easy to split up parallelizable tasks into separate processes.
* GUI-based programs to do basic sequence manipulations, translations, BLASTing, etc.
Extensive documentation and help with using the modules, including this file, on-line wiki documentation, the web site, and the mailing list.
* Integration with BioSQL, a sequence database schema also supported by the BioPerl and BioJava projects.
