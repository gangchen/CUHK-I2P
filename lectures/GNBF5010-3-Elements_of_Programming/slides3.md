Program = Data Structure + Algorithm

Programming = Designing and Implementing of Data Structure and Algorithm

Lecture 5 : Data Structures and Algorithms
---

1. Basic data types are bricks to build advanced data structures.

2. Flow control statements are the language to describe algorithms.

3. Functions and modules help us organize the source codes of a program.

4. OOP tells us how to design the architecture of your program to integrate data structures and algorithms.

Lecture 3 covers 1-3, and 4 is covered in Lecture 4.
