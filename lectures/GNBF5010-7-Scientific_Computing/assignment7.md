Designing and developing a FASTA file analysis system in python.

Try to answer following questions before coding:

1. What analysis should be provided in this system?
2. How to store the data in memory?
3. Do you need database?
4. What will happen if the input file is not a standard FASTA file?
5. What is the running time of your system to process a 10 MB FASTA file? Try to optimize it.
6. Does your potential users needs a graphical user interface?
7. Can we implement the system as a website? What is the advantages and disadvantages for users? Is there any method to avoid these disadvantages?

* Discuss and try to answer above questions as a group.
* Each group has four or five members.
* Giving a name to your system.
* Try to design the architecture of your system.
* Try to implement it in python.
* Try to develop an advance feature other than basic statistical analysis.

Tips and References:
* Study FASTA related classes and their methods in BioPython, BioPerl or other bioinformatics packages.
* Search "FASTA" in Oxford Bioinformatics, PLoS Computational Biology, Genome Biology, Nature Genetics and other genomics journals to understand how do the scientists use FASTA in their researches.
* Search "FASTA" in github, sourceforge to find more FASTA related open source projects to get ideas on advance features for your system.

* Recall the codes in previous lectures :)
