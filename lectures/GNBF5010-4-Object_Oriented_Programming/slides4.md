# Outline

OOP = Object Oriented Programming
* OOP Basics
* OOP in Python
* Design Pattern in Python
* Examples

# OOP Basics
---
## OOP
---
## Classes and Instances
* Objects Combine state (data) and behavior (algorithms).
Encapsulation
* Classes Define what is common for a whole class of objects

### Encapsulation
Dividing the code into a public interface, and a private implementation of that interface.
---

### Polymorphism
The ability to overload standard operators so that they have appropriate behavior based on their context
Inheritance.
---
### Inheritance
The ability to create subclasses that contain specializations of their parents.

# Design Pattern in Python
---

## Design Pattern
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution
to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

Best reference is “Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software.” (1995), written by the “Gang of Four” (GoF).
